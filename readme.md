# Sonic Pi Examples
These are just a few examples of small functions written for the application Sonic Pi and my first step into programing.

Sonic Pi takes the code you write and turns it into sounds that can looped together to make music that can be altered live. I used to help me gain an understanding of how small bits of code come together to form a larger picture.

The different files contain loops that when strung together make music that can be changed on the fly.

Download and install Sonic Pi, load the any of the examples and play them to see how it sounds.
